# Studying List

Welcome to My Studying List!

In this collection, you'll find a carefully curated selection of books, articles, paper, and video that I'm either currently exploring, have completed, or intend to delve into in the near future. This section will continuously evolve as I discover new, exciting materials. I'll be crafting insightful summaries and notes for every piece I delve into. These will serve as my personal reference and perhaps provide a glimpse into the knowledge that's transformed my thinking.
