     * Instead of making use of the callstack, unsafeRun will call x() then continue by calling
     * f on the result of x(). f will return  either Suspend, Return or Flatmap transferring back
     * control to unsafeRun. Our IO program is therefore a kind of coroutine that executes cooperatively with unsafeRun.
     * It continually makes either Suspend or FlatMap IO request and each time it does so, it suspends its own execution
     * and return control to unsafeRun. It's actually unsafeRun that drive the execution forward one suspension at a time.
     * unsafeRun is sometimes called trampoline and the overall technique of returning control to a single loop to eliminate
     * stack is called trampolining
